# Chapter 10
Ask rain from the LORD in the <span class="blue">season of the spring rain</span>, from the LORD who makes the storm clouds, and he will give them showers of rain, to everyone the vegetation in the field. For the household gods utter nonsense, and the diviners see lies; they tell false dreams and give empty consolation. Therefore the people wander like sheep; they are afflicted for lack of a shepherd.

“My anger is hot against the shepherds, and I will punish the leaders; for the **LORD of Hosts** cares for his flock, the house of ${place()}Judah, and will make them like his majestic steed in battle. From him shall come the cornerstone, from him the tent peg, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler—all of them together. They shall be like mighty men in battle, trampling the foe in the mud of the streets; they shall fight because the LORD is with them, and they shall put to shame the riders on horses.

“I will strengthen the house of ${place()}Judah, and I will save the house of ${person()}Joseph. I will bring them back because I have compassion on them, and they shall be as though I had not rejected them, for I am the LORD their God and I will answer them. Then ${place()}Ephraim shall become like a mighty warrior, and their hearts shall be glad as with wine. Their children shall see it and be glad; their hearts shall rejoice in the LORD.

“I will whistle for them and gather them in, for I have redeemed them, and they shall be as many as they were before. Though I scattered them among the nations, yet in far countries they shall remember me, and with their children they shall live and return. I will bring them home from the land of ${place()}Egypt, and gather them from ${place()}Assyria, and I will bring them to the land of ${place()}Gilead and to ${place()}Lebanon, till there is no room for them. He shall pass through the sea of troubles and strike down the waves of the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall be dried up. The pride of ${place()}Assyria shall be laid low, and the scepter of ${place()}Egypt shall depart. I will make them strong in the LORD, and they shall walk in his name,” declares the LORD.
